                <p>With the aim to equip incoming BS Physics freshmen and sophomores of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) this academic year, the PUP Physics Society launched the month-long Online Tutorial 2020 last August 6 .</p>
                <p>Joined by a total of 49 students, the online tutorial consisted of 29 freshmen and 20 sophomores who underwent two sessions per week held online via zoom meetings, and complemented by reading assignments, and problem sets.</p>
                <p>The tutors who are junior and sophomore students from the same program supervised the preview-learning of the tutees for main subjects: Physics and Mathematics every Wednesday and Saturday.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“Studying became difficult this quarantine due to factors such as  distractions and poor internet connectivity which the tutorial addressed by helping me to easily comprehend the lessons and to excel in my class,”  – expressed Physics sophomore-tutee Wismar Dave Salas.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Salas said the online tutoring helped me to study and understand lessons in advance. It taught me those fundamental knowledge which will be a great help in studying this semester.</p>
                <p>However, PUP Physics Society Vice President Cristina Mortel called anew for adjustments amidst the concerns faced by the organization during the tutorial program.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“We had this issue where students need to work, need to focus with household chores, tutors having another schedule for the week [outside the program], and both students and tutors wanting to leave the program,” – voiced Mortel.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>According to the organization Vice President, adjustments and not complete attendance should be urged as the said situations will be a problem for the online classes as well.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, she assured that the Online Tutorial Program will continue throughout the whole academic year by way of scheduled sessions to continuously assist its members.</p>
