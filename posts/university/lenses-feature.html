                <p>Physics can be difficult due to its complexity, but few students showed otherwise. Let’s delve into the eyes of the students taking the program and how they turn their struggles into fun and interactive entertainment.</p>
                <p>Last July, the Physics Society of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines launched the Lenses Production. An interactive multimedia organization that aims to provide both entertainment and knowledge. Its main purpose is to nurture and hone its member’s potential while providing quick and fun videos for the students taking the said program.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“Lenses Production gave me the opportunity to enhance our skills in<br>
                different areas like, it enhance my writing skill and also lenses<br>
                gives me the opportunity to enter a new kind of writing." <br>
                <br>– Lemuel Villegas, one of the scriptwriters, said in our interview.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Through the rigorous production process and filtered ideas, the production team has come up with future exciting videos including PHYSEEKS, hosted by Gifford Villanueva, April Capangpangan, and Josua Costibolo. A talk show that features students and their experiences, preparations, life struggles, and coping mechanism during this tiring pandemic.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“I think we could provide something that gives information about PUP<br>
                and its Physics Program through the use of entertainment.” <br><br>– Florenz
                Pagulayan, director of the Lenses Production.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This production could also serve as a sneak peek at what Physics students do most of the time, and it could also be a fun way to discover the culture and traditions inside the walls of PUP. So if you’re planning on enrolling in this program, you should check out their short films and talk shows.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>“It started with a group of individuals who wanted to do more for<br>
                other students that wanted to explore in art and multimedia but did<br>
                not have the means to do so” <br><br>– Mark Arganda, the assistant audio
                director as he describes how it all started.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The Lenses Production started as an AVP team, only this year they launched an official name. Just two weeks after their initial launch, one of their posts went viral and reached over a million Facebook users. It was the interactive Leave-a-dot Sheldon Cooper post. However, according to Mark Arganda, the post was stolen by another page.</p>
                <p>How do ideas become produced films, you ask? We talked to a few people behind the team to give you some insights and clue on how they ensure the quality of their videos.</p>
                <p>According to Kherzie Andal, one of the video editors, the team starts with brainstorming through a virtual meeting. The Content specialist mostly comes up with content then the scriptwriters improve it. Researchers then start to find the flaws and fix them with their research on the field. After some thorough research and proofreading, the director will check the content proposal for approvals. The content specialist, scriptwriters, and researchers are responsible for formulating the scripts and studies the topic they’ve come up with. Director will then film and direct the actors, and hosts.</p>
                <p>Post-production consists of audio directors and video editors, edits, cuts, and assembling the raw footage. They also music and effects. The last stage was screening. All members of the production team will assemble to watch their final output.</p>
                <p>Everyone in the Lenses Production is excited to push their limits and to give us quality content ranging from enjoyable fun talk shows to insightful educational short films that will entice future enrollees to pursue their passion in Physics. May the force be equal to mass times acceleration.</p>
